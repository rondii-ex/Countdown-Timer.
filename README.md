I created a countdown timer using html,css and javascript.
Html and Css were fun but javascript would prolly be annoying for you but thats the purpose of this project to help you understand and be more exposed to javascript.
The animation thing i did was styled in css it was pretty easy and honestly there are lotta researches that are open to you for free to help you improve your skills so utilize the oppurtunity.
